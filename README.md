# Zen Cart - PayPal Sandbox setup
How to setup sandbox accounts for development testing of PayPal Express Checkout

Create sandbox accounts
In developer.paypal.com, create an account using your real PayPal address (the one you will be using for your shop) & Login
In SANDBOX->Accounts

You need at least two sandbox accounts
Business type, which will be the shop sandbox account. Use this account email and password to login to sandbox.paypal.com and make changes as though for your shop details.
Note the details for this account as they will be used in the ZC Admin configuration for the PayPal payment module:
API credentials Username
Password
Signature
Account Merchant ID
Note that in the Settings you can set fault conditions to test error/failed transaction handling.

Personal type, which will be the buyer account. Use this account email and password to login to sandbox.paypal.com and make changes with addresses etc, as though it was a real customer, or create other sandbox personal accounts if you wish to test very different characteristics.
